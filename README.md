# Project-1
For this project, I decided to make a simple calculator in python, whereby I used python IDLE to write the scripts. The calculator performs a total of four operations: (1). Addition; (2). Subtraction; (3). Multiplication; and (4). Division. The calculator works simply by asking the user to enter the first digit and then the second digit to perform the selected operations from the given list. 
In particular, the following are the steps to perform the operations on the calculator: 
1.	Select the operation from the list i.e., 1, 2, 3, 4. For example, the user selects 1 
2.	Entering the first digit. For example, 20 
3.	Entering the second digit. For example, 40 
4.	Output. For example, 60 (as the user selected 1 i.e., Addition).
